## Coding Standards

### OCaml Style Guide

#### Naming Conventions
```ocaml
(* Module names: PascalCase *)
module FederatedLearning = struct ... end

(* Type names: snake_case *)
type model_config = { ... }
type client_update = { ... }

(* Function names: snake_case *)
let train_client model data config = ...
let aggregate_updates updates = ...

(* Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE *)
let DEFAULT_LEARNING_RATE = 0.1
```

#### Code Formatting
```ocaml
(* Use 2-space indentation *)
let example_function x y =
  let result =
    if x > y then
      x + y
    else
      x - y
  in
  result * 2

(* Keep lines under 100 characters when possible *)
(* Add spaces around operators *)
let sum = a + b * c

(* Use meaningful variable names *)
(* Good *)
let training_loss = compute_loss predictions labels

(* Bad *)
let l = f p l
```

#### Documentation Comments
```ocaml
(** Main documentation comment for the function

    @param model The neural network model
    @param data Training data for the client
    @param config Training configuration parameters
    @return Updated model with gradients
*)
val train_client : model -> client_data -> training_config -> client_update

(* Inline comments for complex logic *)
(* Clip gradients to prevent exploding gradients *)
let clipped = clip_gradients gradients max_norm
```

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

#### Unit Tests
All new features must include unit tests. Add tests to `test/test_CryptaLearn.ml`:

```ocaml
let test_new_feature () =
  Printf.printf "Testing new feature...\n";

  (* Setup *)
  let input = create_test_input () in

  (* Execute *)
  let result = new_feature input in

  (* Verify *)
  assert_true (result > 0) "Result should be positive";
  Printf.printf "  âœ“ New feature test passed\n"
```

#### Test Coverage
Aim for comprehensive test coverage:
- **Federated Learning**: Model creation, training, aggregation
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Key generation, encryption, operations
- **Differential Privacy**: Noise mechanisms, privacy accounting
- **DP-SGD**: Gradient clipping, privacy-utility tradeoff

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all unit tests
dune runtest

# Run specific test
dune exec test/test_CryptaLearn.exe

# Run with specific epsilon value
dune exec bin/main.exe -- --dp-epsilon 0.5 --seed 42
```

### Test Requirements
- All tests must pass before submitting a PR
- New features require corresponding tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Use `--seed 42` for reproducible tests

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Guidelines
- Profile before optimizing
- Focus on algorithmic improvements first
- Consider memory usage for large datasets
- Use benchmarks to measure improvements

### Benchmarking
```bash
# Run experiments with timing
./run_privacy_experiments.sh

# Results include timing information for HE operations
```

---

## Security Considerations

### Privacy-Preserving Code
- Never log sensitive data
- Ensure proper noise calibration in DP mechanisms
- Validate privacy budget tracking
- Test privacy guarantees thoroughly

### Cryptographic Operations
- Use established cryptographic libraries
- Follow security best practices
- Document security assumptions
- Review cryptographic code carefully

---

## Documentation Standards

### API Documentation
```ocaml
(** Train a client model with differential privacy guarantees.

    This function implements DP-SGD (Differentially Private Stochastic
    Gradient Descent) following Abadi et al. (2016).

    @param model The initial model to train
    @param data Training data for this client
    @param config DP-SGD configuration including clip_norm and noise_multiplier
    @return Client update with gradients and training statistics

    @raise Invalid_argument if clip_norm <= 0 or noise_multiplier < 0

    Example:
    {[
      let config = {
        batch_size = 32;
        learning_rate = 0.1;
        num_epochs = 5;
        clip_norm = 1.0;
        noise_multiplier = 4.84;
        dp_epsilon = 1.0;
        dp_delta = 1e-5;
      } in
      let update = train_client_dp_sgd model data config
    ]}
*)
val train_client_dp_sgd : model -> client_data -> dp_sgd_config -> client_update
```
